### A campaign for greater digital inclusion in Mozambique
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">
Over the last few months we have teamed up with UK-based non-profit **[Data4Change](https://www.data4chan.ge/)** to carry out a data-driven investigation into the state of web accessibility in Mozambique.

<br>

To do this, we carried out automated accessibility testing on 18,704 web pages across 90 key Mozambican websites, including key government services, health news sites and online shopping.

<br>

The results are in and we can now reveal that, on average, each single web page that we tested contained 38 accessibility violations. This amounted to more than 700,000 barriers in total. 

<br>

It matters: each barrier stops someone with an impairment from engaging with a web page, sometimes for key services. Some of the worst-performing websites that we tested include a job ads site, a large telecoms provider and a government tax authority.

>> In most websites there comes a stage when it is not possible to use. I finished my studies recently and when I went to the job website, I was not able to apply for a job, because when I get to the end of the first page of jobs I can't move onto the next. I end up giving up.

<br>

**[a11y.co.mz](https://a11y.co.mz/en/about/)** was designed and developed by **Am√≠lcar Paco**, and Data4Change.

<br>

FAMOD believes that access to the internet is essential for people with disabilities. It is clear from the results of this investigation that the majority of websites, including those providing public and essential services, remain largely inaccessible for persons with disabilities. As a result, we plan to strengthen the advocacy work in this area and we look forward to working with political authorities, the private sector and donors as part of this effort.
